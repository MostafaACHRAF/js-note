# Loops
They are three types of loops in javascript.

## While loop
Good to use when we don't know the exact number of iterations we are going to have.
A "while loop" is composed of three components :

1- Indexer (a variable that we will evalute against our condition, if true we continue, otherwise we get out of the loop)
2- Condition (while this condition is true, we will iterate over and over)
3- change the value of the indexer (we must not forget to change the value of the indexer to get out of the loop)

## For loop

Like "while loop" the difference is the three components {indexer, condition, changing indexer's value} are done in just one line.

## For of loop

Good when we iterate over and array or a collection of objects. We don't to take care of the indexer variable of the condition.
